                            <p>I actively sought a software developer position at IBM for my year in industry while at university. Within IBM Software, I worked in the Client Outreach and Developer Advocacy (CODA) team, which operated under the WebSphere (Cloud) organisation. 
                            My daily tasks consisted of improving, reviewing, and testing java guides which were created to enhance client’s systems through the utilisation of microservices and cloud native applications.
                            I developed my understanding of technology via debugging and support for international clients, researching and creating code in addition to monitoring and testing new or existing systems. Moreover, I developed my communication and presenting abilities when speaking to clients about high level software specifications and giving multiple talks about emerging technologies at internal and external forums and conferences e.g., DevoxxUK 2023. </p>

                            <p>During my final year of university, I chose to aid computer science students in understanding the importance of a year in industry and its benefits for their future career prospects as it has done for myself. I met with both undergraduate and postgraduates that need advice on improving their CV’s, cover letters and general tips for interviews or assessment centres. It has been a rewarding experience that has developed my communication skills overall.</p>

                            <p>I quickly adapted to the intensity of this retail environment in addition to meeting the expectations of my manager and team. From helping customers design their homes to unloading and creating my own displays in store, I have gained much more experience on how to be more independent and meet the needs of customers. Having built a strong rapport with my team and the manager I was able to take on additional and advanced tasks which had required more responsibility, despite not working in the store for a great amount of time.</p>

                            <p>Having not worked as a customer service assistant before, I took a leap and decided to take on the new experience. I have learned how to communicate and build a rapport with customers in addition to working with a team to meet deadlines and support each other when needed. I really enjoy helping customers with any problems or questions, as I am dedicated to representing the company in the best light as well as improving my own personal qualities. I believe this was the cause of my promotion as Property Account Manager. This role introduced new skills including mediating between buyers and sellers as well as resolving complaints from unhappy customers, in effect developing my responsibility.</p>

                            <p>I had independently sought work experience with Solirius Ltd an IT consultancy company that specialises in providing bespoke programs for a range of different organisations. This opportunity allowed me to understand how programming specialists provide integrated solutions for the private and public sector. I was responsible for writing my own programmes which were assessed by the team as well as having the opportunity to enhance and contribute to the company’s website. I was also able to shadow the finance manager and aid in amending reports, writing up documents and calculating important data which was directly used within the company. I gained a vast amount of knowledge from this experience which has helped me understand how a company truly functions.</p>

                    <p>Outside of my studies, I keep up to date with current updates within Technology and focus on emerging technologies that will inevitably impact my future within the sector and how I can adopt it from an early stage.</p>
                    
                    <p>To keep active, I play football and train frequently at the gym to develop my endurance and strength. In comparison, I often indulge in watching a variety of movies and TV series from all eras. I am trying to increase the amount of books I read for both pleasure and knowledge!</p>
                                        
                    <p>I enjoy travelling and discovering new cultures. Food is a massive part of my life, and I aim to try foods from all over the world. My ultimate aim is to explore the majority of the world... I have currently have reached 22 countries spanning 4 continents.</p>
